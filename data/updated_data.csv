- restore degraded soils: cashew trees have the capacity to achieve this in a costefficient way, and thus positively affect the climate (0.33 tco2e/ha stored in soils) and adaptation capacities (through soils fertility and water quality preservation). it is worth noting that cashew planting was first introduced in burkina faso for this

component 1 - the existing hydroclimatological and environmental information system (heis) is strengthened and used by local- and regional-level stakeholders, improving their resilience to the impacts of climate change: hydrologic models, climate scenarios, mechanisms for gathering and processing data and an early warning sytem for extreme weather events
component 2 - rehabilitation of wetlands and their hydrology in the target area as a means to reduce risk to flooding and drought associated with climate change and variability: hydraulic works for flood control and hydraulic management, restoration of ecosystem measures.
component 3 - introduction of climate change-resilient agroecological practices and building designs helps local communities to reduce their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change: agroecological practices and adaptive architecture program, agrosilvopastural models into the multiple use fluvial landscape
component 4 - relevant institutional and social structures strengthened for mainstreaming climate risk management and adaptation measures into planning and decision-making processes: establisment of a platform at community level for adoption and scaling up of climate resilient measures, training programs with communitites and civil servants, climate risk management considerations are incorporated into local planning, in accordance with national planning.

the program will incentivize socially responsible investments (including through the participation of the private sector) and will ensure environmental dimensions are mainstreamed in the economic development of the orinoquía region, including resilience to future climatic shocks. also, through the payment of carbon credits, the program will support an equitable distribution of the climate benefits to help reduce poverty and vulnerability. the proposed program therefore contributes to the country partnership strategy goals and the government of colombia’s national development strategy.",IBRD,Multiple,0,2018.0,2023,1,5,20.0,0,0,0

deforestation levels in ecuador amounted to 109,000 hectares per year between 2000 and 2009, with over 99% of deforested land being transformed into agricultural areas. ecuador’s redd+ action plan addressed the drivers of this deforestation, with the aim of achieving net zero deforestation by 2020.
gcf’s investment will co-finance the action plan. targeted investment will control agricultural expansion into forest areas, whilst agricultural and livestock production practices will be implemented to reduce deforestation. land-use zoning plans will be aligned with national climate change-related targets, and measures will be implemented to support restoration, conservation and sustainable production in vulnerable watersheds. the project will also ensure that financial instruments are aligned with the objectives of the action plan, by orienting public credit lines towards sustainable agricultural production practices, promoting tax incentives for redd-supportive activities, and strengthening purchasing policies for deforestation-free commodities, their certification and traceability.",UNDP,Ministry of Environment,Public Sector,2016.0,2022,1,6,41.17,0,0,0

the programme will deliver on this objective through four components:
component 1: increased water availability and erosion control through floodwater harvesting and irrigation technologies, consructions of micro dams, solar and water conservations measures to improve runoff management and infiltration. 
component 2: enhanced climate-resilient agricultural and livestock production, including the use of drought and disease resistant  varieties, integrated crop-livestock production systems, conservation agriculture, agroforestry, rangeland management and traditional improved fuel-efficient stoves and seasonal forecast. 
component 3: improved climate risk information and climate monitoring used to raise awareness of and enhance community preparedness to climate change hazards
component 4: lessons learned and shared and policy influenced through knowledge management system

the indian state of odisha is highly vulnerable to climate change due to high monsoon variability. this has caused drought and flood affecting the food security of agriculture dependent communities and particularly affecting vulnerable communities. extreme food insecurity is combined with water scarcity as there is a lack of infrastructure for water conservation.
these climate related challenges will be addressed by enhancing ground water recharge in the community ponds through structural adaptation measures, and the use of solar pumps for micro irrigation. the ground water recharge measures will improve water security and quality for around 5.2 million beneficiaries in vulnerable communities through the installation of groundwater recharge shafts in 10,000 tanks. tanks and ponds in the region provide effective rainwater collection, but are inefficient at recharging groundwater due to low permeable soil. ground water recharge shafts can be transformative by demonstrating their ability to recharge the underlying aquifier system, developing long-term groundwater reserves. at the same time, resilient crop planning through irrigation will improve food security in the region, whilst the use of solar pumps for irrigation will increase energy access and contribute to the state’s climate-resilient, low emission crop planning.",National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD),Multiple,Public Sector,2017.0,2023,1,6,34.36,0,0,0

component 1: scientific and technical capacity (usd 675,000) 
 
the project will support the selection of a limited number of optimal integrated rice cultivation models, or systems. the project will also provide the tools for crop modeling and vulnerability analysis, particularly focusing on the rice sector, as well as the development of a climate-based hydrological model for the region, in order to gain a sound grasp of future water availability. as a means of providing stronger technical support to local producers, the project will also provide enhanced agro-climatic services, including updated crop and cultivation calendars that take new climate trends into account.  the project will extend climate and weather information to local producers, which is currently not practiced in the region, for early warning purposes, specifically for floods and droughts as well as for transmission of technological knowledge regarding rice cultivation.  
 
 
 
component 2: adapted and resilient rice production cycle (usd 2,760,000) 
 
this component, which comprises the bulk of the project, is comprised of 3 sub-components targeted to each step of the production cycle.  based on the outputs of component 1, and on existing scientific and technical knowledge, this component aims to implement a set of changes to the rice cultivation cycle.   
 
sub-component 2a concerns primarly òinput managementó and is concerned with providing farmers with the appropriate working material, starting with adapted seeds and varieties, appropriate fertilizers and adequate quantities and quality of water. 
 
sub-component 2.2 òproduction managementó, concerns primarily the land and agrobiodiversity management practices involved in rice production, including sustainability land mangement and agroforestry practices.  
 
sub-component 2.3 concerns primarily harvest management, and is designed to assist communities in coping with climate shocks such as droughts and floods, and to reduce post harvest losses.   
 
 
 
component 3: leveraging policy change (usd 120,000) 
 
this component aims to deal with the specific policy barriers that prevent adaptation in the rice sector, while also providing tools and methods that might be applicable to other sectors, agricultural or not.  the project will support the creation of an effective interministerial and multipartner platform on rice resilience, that will bring together government, private sector, ngos, as well as academic and research institutions and local representatives.  its purpose will be to examine current policies with a view to identifying gaps and potential maladaptations, and to make recommendations on the modification of policies, rules and norms related to rice.  finally, this component will also allow for the deployment of knowledge sharing activities designed to support replication and upscaling of successful approaches, and to generate broader scientific knowledge on rice adaptation.

component 1: establishment of integrated, climate-resilient water supply and management systems in mahibadhoo, ihavandhoo and gadhdhoo.  this effort will involve a) the planning and installation of groundwater protection and recharge measures using surplus rainwater and improved management of wastewater; b) the redesign of existing rainwater harvesting schemes, including optimization of total storage capacity to meet supply needs in dry periods; interconnection of isolated units to ensure equitable water supply in dry periods; improvement of structural integrity of rainwater collection and storage systems against extreme weather events; integration of filter elements to improve safety of freshwater supply; c) the systematic improvement of septic tank maintenance and redesign of wastewater management schemes to ensure sufficient quantities of safe groundwater during dry periods and prevent polluted wastewater to undermine freshwater stocks in time of climate-induced water scarcity; and d) the application of desalination technology in the context of a diversified, integrated water supply and distribution infrastructure, ensuring supply capacity of at least 20 liters per person per day during dry spells and climatic extremes.
 
component 2: increase participation in the development, allocation and monitoring of freshwater use in a changing climate.  this will introduce a range of communication, awareness and training activities which will enable public, private and communal stakeholders (including water suppliers, planners and users) to effectively engage with each other and participate in the inclusive development, allocation and planning of water resource use on their home islands.
 
component 3: replication and upscaling of climate-resilient freshwater management.  these will enable the analysis, replication and upscaling of the project approach on other inhabited islands. this will entail a campaign to present the findings from the project to different public entities, political authorities, utility companies and development partners, as well as other atolls and islands with similar degrees of vulnerability. this campaign will integrate all administrative regions and aim at the replication of the project approach in at least 4 other inhabited islands. exchange programmes to the target sites in mahibadhoo, ihavandhoo and gadhdhoo will be facilitated to promote learning and transfer of experience on climate-resilient freshwater management (especially with regards to the design of coupled rainwater harvesting/groundwater recharge schemes). at the level of the central government, a consultative mechanism will be created that allows the integration of project experiences into the design and rollout of new water management projects and schemes.",UNDP,Ministry of Housing and Environment,0,2011.0,2016,1,5,8.99,0,SIDS - AIMS,0

with imported fossil fuels supplying 84 percent of mauritius’ primary energy requirements, the country is vulnerable to outside energy shocks, like many other small island developing states (sids). also, greenhouse gas emissions are increasing at a rate of 3 percent per year, while the country’s energy generation mix is dominated by imports of coal (39 percent) and fuel oil (38 percent).
this project is aimed at enabling the government of mauritius to meet its target of using renewables to supply 35 percent of the country’s energy needs by 2025. this is part of a broad national strategy to reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels – to enhance energy security and climate change mitigation, and to improve the country’s balance of payments.
the project will remove bottlenecks to investments in low-carbon development in two phases:  
•phase 1: supporting grid-connected, intermittent renewable energy; and
•phase 2: establishing a photovoltaic mini-power grid for mauritius’ principle outer island, agalega. 
the project’s first phase (2017-2019) will strengthen the ability of the energy grid to use electricity generated by renewables and support institutional strengthening through the operationalization of the mauritius renewable energy agency (marena).
the second phase (2020-2024) will draw upon lessons learned during the first phase to accelerate the deployment of solar energy in agalega. the ability to supply clean energy to a remote island like agalega is a good example that can be replicated in other sids.",UNDP,Ministry of Finance and Economic Development,0,2016.0,2025,1,9,28.21,0,SIDS - AIMS,0

the argan forest of morocco, covering 2.5 million hectares, is recognised by unesco as a biosphere reserve with a rich biodiversity. there has been a “market boom” in argan oil, and its rising demand has improved household income for local communities but generated serious pressure on the natural forest, threatening its sustainability. the forest is also threatened by the impact of climate change upon its regeneration.
morocco committed within its indc to reduce its greenhouse gases (ghg) emission by 32% by 2030 through mitigation activities. morocco intends to plant 43,000 hectares of argan tree orchards and promote arganiculture as a priority activity to reduce ghg emissions. this project will strengthen the resilience of rural communities and the arganeraie biosphere reserve through planting 10,000 ha of argan tree orchards with soil conservation and rain water harvesting capabilities. supporting argan plantations and arganiculture will also contribute to relieve the anthropic pressure on the natural forest, and improve livelihoods of the communities by moving from a model of fruit collection from natural forests towards sustainable forest co-management.",ADA (Agency for Agricultural Development) Morocco,National Agency for the Development of Oases and Argan Zones (ANDZOA),0,2016.0,2022,1,6,39.29,0,0,0

the boudnib valley has a high vulnerability to increased temperatures and water scarcity  as the effects of climate change. the local population relies on oasis-based agriculture along the guir wadi, which is an intermittent river severely affected by several years of drought and irregularity. small-scale oasis farming has created a poverty trap that forces many to migrate in search of employment.
recently, however, new investments have changed the situation on the ground by expanding agriculture beyond the oasis areas. these relatively large scale farms produce quality dates and olives through the exploitation of deep groundwater by pumping. 
ensuring the long-term preservation of underground water supplies is essential to protect both oasis subsistence farming and the larger-scale date and olive farms from climate change risks. this project will create a connecting irrigation system to the kaddoussa dam that is currently being built upstream of the guir wadi, ensuring downstream agricultural sustainability by providing surface water for farming. this will improve the situation of oasis agriculture and alleviate the pressure on the deep groundwater. the project will build the climate-resilience of oasis communities, and set up cross-cutting sustainability measures such as technical assistance, groundwater preservation, and environmental and social impacts management.",ADA (Agency for Agricultural Development) Morocco,Multiple,0,2017.0,2023,1,6,19.38,0,0,0

the resilience of the saïss plain is threatened by declining and unpredictable rainfall due to climate change, coupled with unsustainable groundwater use. water scarcity is chronic, and demand is projected to increase in morocco. 80% of abstracted water is used for agricultural purposes, so this water scarcity threatens agricultural production and rural livelihoods, with climate change being an important risk amplifier.
this project will switch the saïss plain from the use of highly unsustainable groundwater to sustainable surface water. a bulk water transfer scheme from the m’dez dam to the saïss plain will be created, along with the preparation of a public-private partnership (ppp) to implement new irrigation networks. this critical infrastructure will facilitate the transfer of water from a river basin with a surplus of water to the sebou-saïss basin with a shortfall of water resources. 
community involvement in water governance will be promoted, together with improved awareness of climate resilience issues among end users of water services, and the promotion of best-practices, efficient irrigation techniques with a significant demonstration impact across sector and region.
the result will be increased efficiency of water use and services, promoting drip irrigation and modern water demand management methods, thus strengthening capacity for adaptation to climate change in the sebou-saïss basin.",EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development),Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries (MAMF),0,2017.0,2023,1,6,36.0,0,0,0

this objective is aligned with the objective spelled out by the adaptation fund7 to òreduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change, including variability at local and national levelsó. (please see annex k for the fund outcome level alignment).
the strategy of the project to achieve this objective is to reduce the risks and effects from the increasingly recurring incidents of drought through an improved water management, crop and livestock adaptation programme in five of the most vulnerable townships of myanmarõs dry zone. the programme is based on principles of local empowerment and implemented by community-based organizations (cbos) such as village development committees, water user committees, farmer groups, communal forest user groups, and local non-governmental organizations (ngos). the anticipated impact of the project is the reduction of food insecurity and losses from extreme climate events in 50,639 households.
in line with undpõs operational mandate in myanmar as reflected in undp governing council decision 93/218, the proposed project is addressing climate risk resilience through community-based and community-driven adaptation in decentralized settings. at the same time, the project is anticipated to contribute to the implementation of national policies and programmes that are in line with myanmarõs obligations under the unfccc.

namibia’s northern small-scale subsistence farming communities are vulnerable to climate-related challenges as incidents of drought and high temperatures increase. the communities in zambezi, kavango east and west are dependent on primary production and natural resources, rely on rain-fed (dry land crop production) agriculture, and have limited livelihood options and employment opportunities. these communities experience high levels of poverty, and climate change is expected to lead to reduced crop yields, loss of ecosystems services (such as water purification and biomass energy) and ecosystem degradation.
crave will reduce food insecurity by allowing beneficiaries to acquire abilities to adopt conservation agriculture and climate-resilient agricultural practices to produce food, as well as providing them with access to renewable energy.
the project will scale up the adoption of adaptive measures such as conservation agriculture and micro drip irrigation. a centre of excellence, the mashare climate resilient agriculture centre of excellence (mcrace) will also be established, which will carry out demonstration pilots including a fertilizer mixing plant, organic manure and guano trials. farmers will be provided with sustainable access to off-grid solar energy technologies including water pumping for small-scale micro horticultural systems, and refrigeration for harvested food, reducing the dependency on imported fuels.",EIF (Environmental Investment Fund),Multiple,0,2016.0,2022,1,6,9.5,0,0,0

component 1: investments in infrastructure for storing and using rain and surface water in eight micro-watersheds in the upper watershed of the estero real river. this component aims to reduce the risk of climate induced water shortages for small scale domestic and productive uses.
 
component 2: introduction of climate resilient agro-ecological practices to make effective use of available water.
includes the design and utilization of  a series of fundamental changes in the activities of agricultural production, for a more efficient use of water in all production processes, increase infiltration, strengthen soil structure, and stabilize slopes.

component 1: policy recommendations & institutional strengthening to prevent climate change induced glof events in northern pakistan
targeted, evidence-based policy recommendations on glof prevention and risk management will be prepared and disseminated for adoption at national and provincial levels, which will enable the integration of glof risk awareness in all potentially affected sectors. contingency plans & incentive schemes to address glof risks at the policy level will be developed, based on collaboration between affected stakeholders. the basic approach of the project to catalyze policy change will be based on the preparation of written policy recommendations, which are based on evidence from the project and approval from a multi-stakeholder steering committee. these policy recommendations will be submitted to cabinet, with psc members serving as advocates in their respective line ministries.
 
 component 2: strengthening knowledge and  information about glof risks in northern pakistan 
based on a targeted mapping exercise of flooding hazards downstream of potentially hazardous glacier lakes, a locally anchored knowledge base & analytical 
 framework for long-term tracking & management of glof risks will be developed. systematic networking and exchanges with global & regional research institutions and resource centers, as well as with other glof risk management projects in the region will contribute to widening the knowledge base about glof risks in pakistan. existing  indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs and coping mechanisms to address flooding risks in northern pakistan will be documented and factored into the risk reduction and preparedness activities employed by this project. 
  
component 3: demonstration of community-based glof risk management in vulnerable mountain valleys of northern pakistan 
institutional arrangements to devise, operate, test, and maintain a community-based glof risk monitoring & early warning system (high tech and low tech) will be established in a at least 2 high-risk target communities. it will include targeted glof risk mitigation measures for at least 2 communities located in high-risk sites.

this programme covers seven small island developing states (sids) which are some of the some of the world’s smallest, most isolated economies. they are the cook islands, tonga, republic of marshall islands, federated states of micronesia, papua new guinea, nauru and samoa. power generation costs in these countries is among the highest because of their reliance on imported diesel, along with the high transportation costs from distributing the diesel to often highly dispersed populations.
all sids targeted in this programme recognize the benefits of shifting from diesel to renewable energy. this will lead to not only reduced greenhouse gas emissions but also enhanced energy security and improved balance of payments through reduced fossil fuel imports. but they also face various barriers in achieving this aim. this includes the high initial costs of installing renewable energy, the current lack of private sector investment and the pressing need for energy sector reforms.
this programme will initiate a number of paradigm-shifting moves across the seven sids. these include feasibility studies on how to expand renewable energy coverage, reform power utility management and encourage private sector engagement by identifying opportunities for independent power providers. broad initiatives to move sids to renewable energy are being kicked off by an element within the programme to assist the cook islands install battery storage. this will help spur private sector investment to pave the way towards cook islands’ national target of 100 percent renewable energy by 2020.",Asian Development Bank (ADB),Te Aponga Uira; Tonga Power Limited; Marshalls Energy Corporation; Chuuk Public Utilities Corporation; Kosrae Utility Authority; Pohnpei Utilities Corporation; Yap State Public Utilities Corporation; PNG Power Limited; Nauru Utility Corporation; Electricity Power Corporation ,0,2016.0,2025,1,9,17.0,0,SIDS - Pacific,0

component 1: community-engagement in coastal vulnerability assessment, adaptation planning and awareness.   includes cim plans reviewed in 25 districts and updated to integrate climate change-induced disaster risk management principles, adopting a watershed and ridge to reef management approach, village hazard zone relocation plans taking climate risks into account formulated in at least 15 villages in selected districts, training delivered to at least 300 village leaders and cso representatives in 139 villages on review of cim plans and relocation planning process integrating climate risks.

component 2: integrated community ðbased coastal adaptation and disaster risk management measures.  essentially it is the practical adaptation activities identified in the cim plans which are all designed to increase community resilience. in each village a set of concerted adaptation actions will be carried out in a programmatic fashion, in order to have a significant impact on reducing community vulnerability. the actions will be implemented upon the plan base established and reconfirmed under component 1 and require the capacity enhancements which component 3 will deliver. overall infrastructure related improvements represented around 35% of the combined district and village level actions identified in the cim plans. 
 
component 3: institutional strengthening to support climate resilient coastal management policy frameworks
this component will provide for targeted support in key areas in the main ministries responsible for cca action, to secure the institutional and capacity improvements to enable full realization of the benefits of components 1 and 2. the focus has been upon capturing key lessons learned and building capacity improvements in a manner which will ensure they can be sustained as a core activity of the government in future.",UNDP,Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE),0,2011.0,2017,1,6,8.73,0,SIDS - Pacific,0

samoa’s economy and its people’s livelihoods have been heavily impacted by increasingly severe tropical storms. for instance, the total economic impact of cyclone evan which hit samoa in late 2012 was estimated at 40 percent of the country’s gdp at the time. this reflected the undoing of years of economic gains in infrastructure development. projected climate change scenarios indicate samoa is destined to endure further severe climate impacts, including more frequent and extreme rainfall and wind events and sea level rise.
this project will enable the government of samoa to reduce the effect of recurrent flood-related impacts in the vaisigano river catchment, which flows through the area of the national capital apia. recent extreme weather events in this region have resulted in approximately usd 200 million worth of damage during each event.
this project will strengthen adaptive capacity and reduce exposure to climate risks faced by vulnerable communities and infrastructure in the vaisigano river catchment. this region is home to samoa’s highest concentration of public infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and government buildings; as well as private homes and businesses.
specifically, this project will aid the government of samoa enhance its capacities and information base to pursue an integrated approach to reducing vulnerability to flood-related risks; flood-proof key infrastructure in the vaisigano river catchment; and upgrade downstream areas to increase river capacity and allow for the more rapid outflow of flood waters.",UNDP,Ministry of Finance,0,2016.0,2023,1,7,57.72,0,SIDS - Pacific,0

universal grid-connected electricity supply is a major challenge across the 90 solomon island’s inhabited islands. the electrification rate is only around 45%, and many rural areas served by small pv panels, whilst the state-owned power utility siea is almost entirely dependent upon diesel generators for supply to the capital. the solomon islands seeks to greatly increase access to reliable electricity supply, doubling the number of households supplied by siea by 2021, whilst also increasing the use of renewable energy to 50% by 2020.
the tina river hydropower development project (trhdp) will respond to these goals with a 15mw installation providing 65% of electricity demand for the capital honiara by the online date of 2022.  it will lower the cost of electricity supply, and diversify generation capacity towards clean, renewable sources. trhdp will provide the solomon islands with reservoir capacity, giving flexibility to the power system to enable higher penetration of pv power without the need for large and expensive energy storage or diesel generators. it can provide a replicable model for other pacific sids to use hydropower to balance variable solar power.
the green climate fund will support the development by providing a usd 70 million loan over 40 years to finance a portion of the debt of the project company for the hydropower plant development. it will also provide a grant of usd 16 million to co-finance the construction of an access road to the site.

hydropower provides approximately 98% of tajikistan’s electricity. tajikistan’s hydropower plants depend on river basins fed by glacial melt water and snowmelt. however, as the climate warms, most climate models predict significant changes in the dynamics of the tajik precipitation patterns as well as alterations to the country’s glaciers.  the modernisation of a major hydropower facility in tajikistan will protect it against future climate conditions. the infrastructure of tajik hydropower facilities dates from the soviet era and needs renewal to cope with the observed and projected impacts of climate change that is leading to increased hydrological variability. in particular, there is an urgent need to adapt older dams, especially their spillway capacities, to cope with the new climate conditions, including an increase in severe floods.
there are three key components to the project. best international practices will be adopted, and tajik hydropower operators trained, to assess and manage climate risks. institutional capacities and structures for effective transboundary management of hydropower cascades will be developed, within the context of transboundary cooperation and agreements in the region. finally, climate resilience measures will be integrated into the hydropower facility, including structural rehabilitation to optimize its resilience to climate change.

rainfall patterns in the simiyu region have become more unpredictable and increasingly erratic, temperatures are rising, and extreme events such as droughts and floods have become more frequent. as the impact of climate change grows, temperature and extreme weather events such as droughts, heavy rains and flooding are predicted to increase further in both frequency and severity in the future. 
water supply is a major challenge in the simiyu region, where only about 20% of the urban and 40 % of the rural population have access to clean drinking water. simiyu river is now a seasonal, rather than permanent river, and using water from lake victoria is the only feasible solution for safe and reliable drinking water, requiring a drought and flood-resilient water supply system. the region is heavily dependent upon agriculture (75% of the economy and 80% of employment). farming conditions are threatened by the unreliability of the two rainy seasons, and a failure to adapt agricultural practices to the changing climate. 
a holistic approach will be adopted to address these two main drivers for the population’s resilience: sustainable provision of water and farming conditions. the government’s community based adaptation planning will be strengthened, and the climate resilience of water supply infrastructure, sanitation services and agricultural practices will be improved. a community-driven approach will ensure the targeting of the most vulnerable in both the urban and rural population, whilst improving the implementing capacities of local and central government structures.",KfW (Kreditanstalt fur Wiederoufbou),Ministry of Finance and Planning,0,2017.0,2025,1,8,99.52,LDC,0,0

component 1:  policy and instituitonal capacity strengthened to govern more climate resilient water policies.  the focus in in water use for the agriculture sector, particularly for the adoption of high efficiency irrigation techniques, particularly for strategic state crops (and not for private sector agriculture and horticulture).  cost effectiveness analysis results would support regulation on water pricing and water communal management and delivery. 

component 2:   community based adaptation initiative, including water user associations, drip irrigation, harvesting, water points, terracing, intercropping, saksaul planting, irrigaiton canal improvements, among others. 

component 3:  introduction of communal managemetn systems for water delivery services.   aiming at scaling up community based adaptation measures proven in component 2.   it includes the work of water user associations (wua)  and wia led community adaptation plans and investments in water management systems and infrastructure, for at least 4 small scale investments.

vanuatu is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate impacts, including climate-related natural disasters and the effects of slow-onset events such as sea-level rise and ocean acidification. while vanuatu’s geographic location leaves it highly exposed to cyclones, more than 90 percent of its infrastructure, measured in economic terms, is located 500m from the coastline.
the government of vanuatu has identified the need to be able to undertake systematic efforts to inform and prepare its public to manage expected climate changes.
this project will help address this need by achieving a paradigm shift to standardize the use of science-based climate information. this is seen as a necessary base to underpin awareness raising and long-term policy planning around climate change.
this project will expand the use of climate information services (cis) in five targeted sectors: tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, water management and fisheries. specific project goals include building technical capacity to harness and manage climate data, developing practical cis tools, fostering their use and disseminating tailored climate information.
